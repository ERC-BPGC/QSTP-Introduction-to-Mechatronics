We, the instructors of the course, decided to split the course into 3 modules, each module scheduled for 2 weeks.
1. Module 1 contains an introduction to electronics aspect of mechatronics. This module introduces Arduino and the circuits that can be built using Arduino, varying in complexity.
2. Module 2 is about the mechanical aspect of mechatronics. This module gives an introduction to modelling CAD designs in Autodesk Fusion 360. It also discusses about kinematics involved in planning the trajectory of a robot arm.
